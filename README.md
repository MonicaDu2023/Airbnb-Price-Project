# Airbnb-Price-Project
## Motivation
From the customer perspective, it is important to better understand the Airbnb price in order to get the best rates. As the first project of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree, I explored the Airbnb price in Seattle using the kaggle Seattle Airbnb dataset, and addressed three business questions:
* What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? Will prices fluctuate with visitor tendency?
* What are the neighborhoods most requested by Airbnb customers?
* What characteristics affects the price of a listing?

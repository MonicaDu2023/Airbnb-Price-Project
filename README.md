# Airbnb-Price-Project
## Motivation
From the customer perspective, it is important to better understand the Airbnb price in order to get the best rates. I explored the Airbnb price in Seattle using the kaggle Seattle Airbnb dataset, and addressed three business questions:
* What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? Will prices fluctuate with visitor tendency?
* What are the neighborhoods most requested by Airbnb customers?
* What characteristics affects the price of a listing?
## File Description

# Airbnb-Price-Project
## Motivation
From the customer perspective, it is important to better understand the Airbnb price in order to get the best rates. I explored the Airbnb price in Seattle using the kaggle Seattle Airbnb dataset, and addressed three business questions:
* What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? Will prices fluctuate with visitor tendency?
* What are the neighborhoods most requested by Airbnb customers?
* What characteristics affects the price of a listing?
## File Description
* image: this folders stores the .png outputs from the notebook, such as charts and graphs.
* dataoutput: this folders stores the .csv and .json outputs from the notebook. These are supplementary files to help understand some of the transformations applied to the dataset
* airbnbdata: this folder contains a copy of the Airbnb Seattle Data, available at Kaggle
## Summary
I found that the Airbnb price shows a seasonal variation. I built a price predictor based on features from the listings table. Among many features I explored the most important features for the price prediction, and study the correlation between these features and the price, such as accomdates, number of bathrooms... These features can be considered as the most important indictors for evaluating the Airbnb price.
